## üß† Learning Concepts

This project was an opportunity to learn and reinforce several key web development concepts:

### HTML

*   **Semantic HTML:** Using tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>` to create a well-structured and meaningful document.
*   **Linking Assets:** Correctly linking CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and font files.

### CSS

*   **Flexbox and Grid:** For creating responsive and complex layouts.
*   **Custom Properties (Variables):** To maintain a consistent design system for colors, fonts, and spacing.
*   **Animations and Transitions:** Using `@keyframes` and `transition` to create smooth and engaging user interactions.
*   **Custom Fonts:** Importing and using custom fonts with `@font-face`.

### JavaScript

*   **DOM Manipulation:** Selecting and modifying HTML elements to create dynamic content and interactions.
*   **Event Handling:** Listening for user events like mouse movements and clicks to trigger animations and other effects.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** The project uses the GSAP library for more advanced animations, such as the custom cursor and text effects.
